This program was made using React.js and the OpenSea API. 

OpenSea is a marketplace for NFTs. 
Many NFT collections are computer generated composites of traits (ex. mouths, hats, eyes). 
This application accepts the "slug" of any NFT collection on OpenSea as a search term (ex. cryptopunks), 
and displays the rarest NFT in that collection (ex. CryptoPunk #8348) by searching through all of the collection's assets 
and calculating a rarity score for each asset based on the likelyhood of all its traits appearing.
