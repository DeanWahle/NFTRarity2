This program was made using React.js and the OpenSea API. 

OpenSea is a marketplace for NFTs. 
Many NFT collections are made up of computer generated composites with various traits (ex. mouths, hats, eyes). 
This application takes the name of any NFT collection on OpenSea as a search term (ex. cryptopunks), 
and displays the rarest NFT in that collection (CryptoPunk #8348) by searching through all of the collection's assets 
and calculating a rarity score for each asset based on the likelyhood of all of its traits.
